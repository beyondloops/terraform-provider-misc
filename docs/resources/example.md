# misc_echo (Resource)

Echo resource that maintains input data in managed state while preserving sensitive value markings. This resource takes any input structure and echoes it back as output while maintaining Terraform's built-in sensitivity handling in managed state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "misc_echo" "example" {
  input = {
    public_key  = "visible_value"
    private_key = sensitive("secret_value")
    nested = {
      api_url   = "https://api.example.com"
      api_token = sensitive("secret_token")
    }
  }
}

output "processed_data" {
  value = misc_echo.example.input
  # Only non-sensitive fields will be visible in output
}
```
